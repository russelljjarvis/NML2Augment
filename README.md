# NML2Augment
Translate morphologies expressed in NeuroML2/MORPHML to an augmented reality phone environment.

A dockerfile container that acts as a suitable environment is available here: https://hub.docker.com/r/russelljarvis/three_d_printneurons/

If the Dockerfile is built, then demo.py provides a means from moving from SWC->WRL->STL.

Another stage needs to be inserted from moving from NML -> SWC in order to facilitate full NML -> STL

On Augment verify a neoronal morphology by scanning the QR code on an Android device where Augment is installed. Ie the following screenshot is a good demonstration:
